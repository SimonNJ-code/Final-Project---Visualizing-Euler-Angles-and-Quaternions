    "#### 1. Introduction\n",
    "The Arduino Nano is a small microcontroller capable of handling inputs and outputs from various sensors and components. In this project an Arduino Nano is connected to the BNO055 sensor. The BNO055 is an absolute orientation sensor with 9 degrees of freedom (DOF) containing 3 gyroscopes, 3 accelerometers and 3 magnetometers. The combination of the above 9 degrees of freedom allows for accurate orientation estimation of any small project be it a quadcopter, a model rocket or any other configuration in need of attitude estimation. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Arduino Nano is programmed in the Arduino IDE which is a development platform using the C++ programming language. The Arduino IDE does not however posses anywhere near the options for data visualization as does Python. Hence the data will be passed from the BNO055 sensor to the Arduino, and from the Arduino to Python where the data will be analyzed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once the data has been analyzed the visualization part of the project revolves around comparing Euler Angles (*pitch, yaw and roll*) to the more complex but computationally advantageous *quaternions* in Vpython.\n",
    "Below is the physical setup of the project. With the BNO055 on the left hand side and the Arduino on the right. "

    "#### Quaternions\n",
    "Quaternions is another orientation formalism widely used and has the distinct advantage of avoiding gimbal lock. More so a given orientation achieved via Euler Angles is ambigiuous in the sense that a given pitch for the vehicle can be achieved in multiple ways. One way is simply to pitch to the angle, but another way is through a combination of roll and yaw. Quaternions are does not face this problem of ambiguity. \n",
    "Quaternions are four element vectors composed of 3 imaginary numbers and 1 real number. Fortunately the BNO055 comes readily equipped with quaternion algorithims allowing us to grab the data in quaternion form. The code using quaternions in Python is very similar to Euler Angles, except now we're not passing roll, pitch and yaw but the quaternions: quat_1, quat_2, quat_3 and quat_4. The data is still being passed through the COM-port as in the previous examples but now as quaternions. However visualizing a vector with 3 imaginary parts is not easy in 3D euclidean space, we thus need to convert the quaternions back to Euler Angles before we can actually visualize them. The conversion can be seen in the image below. "

    "Using Python to analyze data compared to the Arduino IDE allows for data-manipulation and visualization. The Visual Python library is a great tool for rudimentary animation and real time dynamic visualization. When structuring this project it was important for me to show the basics of Vpython before advancing to the dynamics. This project entails a lot of information not described here, which might make the project hard to read as a stand alone. Looking back this might've been too ambitious a task and for someone not in possession of the hardware it might be hard to relate to the individual steps and why they were carried out the way they were. I decided to include videos as an explanatory means to compensate for the otherwise interactive environment of Vpython. \n",

    "Furhter development of this project should include a more rigorous comparisson of Euler Angles and quaternions. Even though visually one can see the difference this is not the optimal way of comparing the two formalisms. Developing this project has given a new dimension to Python programming for me. It enables the user to actively interact with a real world system and see the necessity of Python compared to the Arduino IDE. Even though the project does not include advanced algorithms it has been a great learning experience. \n"
